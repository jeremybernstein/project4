This directory contains the codebase for the main game engine, leiserchess.

leiserchess.c:

        The main file that implements the UCI specification and
        invokes everything else.

search.c:
        Implements the search routine (scout search).

abort.c:
	Allows the parallel scout search to be aborted due to beta
	cutoff.

eval.c:
        The static evaluator that implements different heuristics of
        the player.

move_gen.c:
        Implements the board representation.

tt.c:
        Implements the transposition table used by the player (a
        hashtable storing positions seen by the player and some other
        relevant information for evaluating a position).

util:
        Utility functions, such as random number generator, printing
        debugging messages, etc.

fen.c:
        The UCI uses the FEN notations (see description of the FEN
        notation in doc/engine-interface.txt), so the program needs to
        translate a FEN string into the underlying board
        representation, and this file contains that logic.
